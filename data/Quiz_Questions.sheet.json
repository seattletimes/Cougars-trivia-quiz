    "description": "Halliday got some Heisman dark horse buzz, but he never made it into the top 10. In his junior season in 2013 he threw for 4,597 yards, but his 22 interceptions may have held him back in the eyes of voters. The next year, he seemed to be in the discussion again, but a broken leg suffered in November ended any hopes he add of a Heisman.",
